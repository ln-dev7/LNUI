# Introduction

Welcome to **LNUI**, a set of components that will allow you to create **beautiful responsive user interfaces** for your web applications.

### What is LNUI ?

**LNUI** is not really a bookshop (or at least not yet) as you might imagine.
It is a set of components that I have developed and that will not need any particular installation.

### Configuration

In most cases we will only need three files **( html, scss, js )**.
Knowing that if you use a framework like **React, Vue ...** you just have to adapt the JS ( if there is any ) according to your framework.
