# About

As some may have noticed, these are some of the interfaces and components I have had to develop in my career as a front-end developer. 
***
I made it so that it would be useful for everyone, but also for me, to gain speed from time to time.
***
A large part of these components and interfaces have been designed by [Johan Gaby](https://twitter.com/mbagnajohan) ( the one to whom I pass a very big thank you for the expertise of his work )
